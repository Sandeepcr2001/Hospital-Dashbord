# 🏥 Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard – Power BI Project  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project showcases an interactive **Hospital Emergency Room (ER) Dashboard** built in **Power BI**.  
The solution empowers healthcare stakeholders to monitor **patient flow, waiting times, satisfaction levels, and referral trends** in real time.  

By leveraging **data modeling, DAX calculations, and compelling visualizations**, the dashboard delivers actionable insights to improve **operational efficiency, patient experience, and resource allocation**.
